** Plan

I want to start things off by starting with a very simple compiler. I'm mostly
interested in the backend/optimizations/code generation part of it, so I'll try
to keep the frontend really tiny.

This is the plan of action.

   - Pick the simplest front-end, which might be lambda calculus or forth. Don't
     waste much time here.
   - Pick a decent backend. LLVM might be the best choice because its rock
     solid, actually usable in the wild and has all the might of Apple behind
     it.
   - Start thinking about an IR.
