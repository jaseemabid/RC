Hello everyone,

I'm Jaseem Abid from Bangalore, India. I grew up in Kerala and moved there about
4 years ago for work.

I'm mostly interested in purely functional programming and distributed systems.
On a larger scale, I'm fascinated by the idea of correct programs and all the
tools and tricks to do that. It's the same reason that got hooked me to Haskell
and eventually to even more precise approaches like formal proofs and
dependently typed programming.

At RC, I'm mostly hoping to work on compilers. I wrote a bit about my plans here
http://jaseemabid.github.io/2017/04/01/rc.html, but I'm still tying to work out
the details. I would love to pair with people experienced with compilers and low
level languages like assembly/llvm etc.

I'm happy to help anyone get started with functional programming. I'm fairly
comfortable with Haskell and Erlang, and can manage a bit of scheme and clojure.

I'm still trying to fix my half baked arch linux + xmonad installation, so any
help is appreciated here :)

Its very nice to see a lot of people with similar goals and interests. I want to
see as much of NYC as possible, so please ping me if you need someone to go a
museum. I'd love that. I've already fallen in love with the parks here! Stefan,
I wanna get back to running too!

I look forward to 3 months of awesomeness!
