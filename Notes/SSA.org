** Single Static Assignment

SSA requires variables to be assigned exactly once, and to be defined before
use. This makes certain compiler optimizations like constant propagation and
dead code elimination simpler.

A ϕ function is used to resolve the ambiguity arising selecting one of the
values arising from multiple branches.

    x = 1          x1 = 1
    if ...         if ...
        x = 2          x2 = 2
    else           else
        x = 3          x3 = 3
                   x4 = phi(x2, x3)

    return x       return x4


A more general question along the same lines is, given an arbitrary control flow
graph, how can I tell where to insert Φ functions, and for what variables?
